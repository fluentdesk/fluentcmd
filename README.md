## Install

Install the latest stable version of HackMyResume with NPM:

```bash
[sudo] npm install hackmyresume -g
```

Power users can install the latest bleeding-edge version (updated daily):

```bash
[sudo] npm install hacksalot/hackmyresume#dev -g
```

**For PDF generation**, you'll need to install a copy of [wkhtmltopdf][3] and/or PhantomJS for your platform.

## Installing Themes

HackMyResume supports both [FRESH][fresh-themes] and [JSON Resume][jrst]-style
résumé themes.

- FRESH themes currently come preinstalled with HackMyResume.
- JSON Resume themes can be installed from NPM, GitHub, or manually.

To install a JSON Resume theme, just `cd` to the folder where you want to store
your themes and run one of:

```bash
# Install with NPM
npm install jsonresume-theme-[theme-name]

# Install with GitHub
git clone https://github.com/[user-or-org]/[repo-name]
```

Then when you're ready to generate your resume, just reference the location of
the theme folder as you installed it:

```bash
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.all -t node_modules/jsonresume-theme-classy
```

Note: You can use install themes anywhere on your file system. You don't need a
package.json or other NPM/Node infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To use HackMyResume you'll need to create a valid resume in either
[FRESH][fresca] or [JSON Resume][6] format. Then you can start using the command
line tool. There are five basic commands you should be aware of:

- **build** generates resumes in HTML, Word, Markdown, PDF, and other formats.
Use it when you need to submit, upload, print, or email resumes in specific
formats.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume BUILD <INPUTS> TO <OUTPUTS> [-t THEME]
    hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.all
    hackmyresume BUILD r1.json r2.json TO out/rez.html out/rez.md foo/rez.all
    ```

- **new** creates a new resume in FRESH or JSON Resume format.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume NEW <OUTPUTS> [-f <FORMAT>]
    hackmyresume NEW resume.json
    hackmyresume NEW resume.json -f fresh
    hackmyresume NEW r1.json r2.json -f jrs
    ```

- **analyze** inspects your resume for keywords, duration, and other metrics.

- **convert** converts your source resume between FRESH and JSON Resume
formats. Use it to convert between the two formats to take advantage of tools
and services.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume CONVERT <INPUTS> TO <OUTPUTS>
    hackmyresume CONVERT resume.json TO resume-jrs.json
    hackmyresume CONVERT 1.json 2.json 3.json TO out/1.json out/2.json out/3.json
    ```

- **validate** validates the specified resume against either the FRESH or JSON
Resume schema. Use it to make sure your resume data is sufficient and complete.

    ```bash
    # hackmyresume VALIDATE <INPUTS>
    hackmyresume VALIDATE resume.json
    hackmyresume VALIDATE r1.json r2.json r3.json
    ```

## Supported Output Formats

HackMyResume supports these output formats:

Output Format | Ext | Notes
------------- | --- | -----
HTML | .html | A standard HTML 5 + CSS resume format that can be viewed in a browser, deployed to a website, etc.
Markdown | .md | A structured Markdown document that can be used as-is or used to generate HTML.
LaTeX | .tex | A structured LaTeX document (or collection of documents) that can be processed with pdflatex, xelatex, and similar tools.
MS Word | .doc | A Microsoft Word office document (XML-driven; WordProcessingML).
Adobe Acrobat (PDF) | .pdf | A binary PDF document driven by an HTML theme (through wkhtmltopdf).
plain text | .txt | A formatted plain text document appropriate for emails or copy-paste.
JSON | .json | A JSON representation of the resume.
YAML | .yml | A YAML representation of the resume.
RTF | .rtf | Forthcoming.
Textile | .textile | Forthcoming.
image | .png, .bmp | Forthcoming.

## Use

Assuming you've got a JSON-formatted resume handy, generating resumes in
different formats and combinations easy. Just run:

```bash
hackmyresume BUILD <INPUTS> <OUTPUTS> [-t theme].
```

Where `<INPUTS>` is one or more .json resume files, separated by spaces;
`<OUTPUTS>` is one or more destination resumes, and `<THEME>` is the desired
theme (default to Modern). For example:

```bash
# Generate all resume formats (HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, YML, etc.)
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.all -t modern

# Generate a specific resume format
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.html
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.pdf
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.md
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.doc
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.json
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.txt
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.yml

# Specify 2 inputs and 3 outputs
hackmyresume BUILD in1.json in2.json TO out.html out.doc out.pdf
```

You should see something to the effect of:

```
*** HackMyResume v1.4.0 ***
Reading JSON resume: foo/resume.json
Applying MODERN Theme (7 formats)
Generating HTML resume: out/resume.html
Generating TXT resume: out/resume.txt
Generating DOC resume: out/resume.doc
Generating PDF resume: out/resume.pdf
Generating JSON resume: out/resume.json
Generating MARKDOWN resume: out/resume.md
Generating YAML resume: out/resume.yml
```

## Advanced

### Applying a theme

HackMyResume can work with any FRESH or JSON Resume theme. To specify a theme
when generating your resume, use the `-t` or `--theme` parameter:

```bash
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/rez.all -t [theme]
```

The `[theme]` parameter can be the name of a predefined theme or the path to any
FRESH or JSON Resume theme folder:

```bash
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/rez.all -t modern
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO OUT.rez.all -t ../some-folder/my-custom-theme/
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO OUT.rez.all -t npm_modules/jsonresume-theme-classy
```

As of v1.4.0, available predefined themes are `positive`, `modern`, `compact`,
`minimist`, and `hello-world`.

### Merging resumes

You can **merge multiple resumes together** by specifying them in order from
most generic to most specific:

```bash
# Merge specific.json onto base.json and generate all formats
hackmyresume BUILD base.json specific.json TO resume.all
```

This can be useful for overriding a base (generic) resume with information from
a specific (targeted) resume. For example, you might override your generic
catch-all "software developer" resume with specific details from your targeted
"game developer" resume, or combine two partial resumes into a "complete"
resume. Merging follows conventional [extend()][9]-style behavior and there's
no arbitrary limit to how many resumes you can merge:

```bash
hackmyresume BUILD in1.json in2.json in3.json in4.json TO out.html out.doc
Reading JSON resume: in1.json
Reading JSON resume: in2.json
Reading JSON resume: in3.json
Reading JSON resume: in4.json
Merging in4.json onto in3.json onto in2.json onto in1.json
Generating HTML resume: out.html
Generating WORD resume: out.doc
```

### Multiple targets

You can specify **multiple output targets** and HackMyResume will build them:

```bash
# Generate out1.doc, out1.pdf, and foo.txt from me.json.
hackmyresume BUILD me.json TO out1.doc out1.pdf foo.txt
```

### Using .all

The special `.all` extension tells HackMyResume to generate all supported output
formats for the given resume. For example, this...

```bash
# Generate all resume formats (HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, etc.)
hackmyresume BUILD me.json TO out/resume.all
```

..tells HackMyResume to read `me.json` and generate `out/resume.md`,
`out/resume.doc`, `out/resume.html`, `out/resume.txt`, `out/resume.pdf`, and
`out/resume.json`.

### Analyzing

HackMyResume can analyze your resume for keywords, employment gaps, and other
metrics. Run:

```bash
hackmyresume ANALYZE <my-resume>.json
```

Depending on the HackMyResume version, you should see output similar to:


```

```

### Validating

HackMyResume can also validate your resumes against either the [FRESH /
FRESCA][fresca] or [JSON Resume][6] formats. To validate one or more existing
resumes, use the `validate` command:

```bash
# Validate myresume.json against either the FRESH or JSON Resume schema.
hackmyresume VALIDATE resumeA.json resumeB.json
```

HackMyResume will validate each specified resume in turn:

```bash
*** HackMyResume v0.9.0 ***
Validating JSON resume: resumeA.json (INVALID)
Validating JSON resume: resumeB.json (VALID)
```

### Converting

HackMyResume can convert between the [FRESH][fresca] and [JSON Resume][6]
formats. Just run:

```bash
hackmyresume CONVERT <INPUTS> <OUTPUTS>
```

where <INPUTS> is one or more resumes in FRESH or JSON Resume format, and
<OUTPUTS> is a corresponding list of output file names. HackMyResume will
autodetect the format (FRESH or JRS) of each input resume and convert it to the
other format (JRS or FRESH).

### External options

Starting in v1.4.x you can pass options into HackMyResume via an external
options or ".hackmyrc" file.

```javascript
{
  // Set the default theme to "compact"
  "theme": "compact",
  // Change the "employment" section title text to "Work"
  "sectionTitles": {
    "employment": "Work"
  }
}
```

### Prettifying

HackMyResume applies [js-beautify][10]-style HTML prettification by default to
HTML-formatted resumes. To disable prettification, the `--no-prettify` or `-n`
flag can be used:

```bash
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json out.all --no-prettify
```

### Silent Mode

Use `-s` or `--silent` to run in silent mode:

```bash
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json -o someFile.all -s
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json -o someFile.all --silent
```
