Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

## How do I get started with HackMyResume?

1. Install with NPM: `[sudo] npm install hackmyresume -g`.

2. Create a new resume with: `hackmyresume NEW <resume-name>.json`.

3. Test with `hackmyresume BUILD <resume-name>.json`. Look in the `out/` folder.

4. Play around with different themes with the `-t` or `--theme` parameter. You can use any [FRESH](https://github.com/fluentdesk/fresh-themes) or [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/themes) theme. The latter have to be installed first.

## What is FRESH?

FRESH is the **F**luent **R**esume and **E**mployment **S**ystem for **H**umans. It's an open-source, user-first workflow, schema, and set of practices for technical candidates and recruiters.

## What is FRESCA?

The **F**RESH **R**esume and **E**mployment **SC**hem**A**&mdash;an open-source, JSON-driven schema for resumes, CVs, and other employment artifacts. FRESCA is the recommended schema/format for FRESH, with optional support for JSON Resume.

## What is JSON Resume?

An [open resume standard](http://jsonresume.org/themes/) sponsored by Hired.com. Like FRESCA, JSON Resume is JSON-driven and open-source. Unlike FRESCA, JSON Resume targets a worldwide audience where FRESCA is optimized for technical candidates.

## Should I use the FRESH or JSON Resume format/schema for my resume?

Both! The workflow we like to use:

1. Create a resume in FRESH format for tooling and analysis.
2. Convert it to JSON Resume format for additional themes/tools.
3. Maintain both versions.

Both formats are open-source and both formats are JSON-driven. FRESH was designed as a universal container format and superset of existing formats, where the JSON Resume format is intended for a generic audience.

## How do I use a FRESH theme?

FRESH themes currently come preinstalled with HackMyResume.

1. Specify the theme name in the `--theme` or `-t` parameter to the **build** command:

    ```bash
    hackmyresume BUILD my-resume.json --theme <theme-name>
    ```

    `<theme-name>` can be one of `positive`, `compact`, `modern`, `minimist`, `hello-world`, or `awesome`.

2. Check your output folder. Although under FRESH, HTML formats are hardened to a degree for local file access, it's best to view HTML formats over a local web server connection.

## How do I use a JSON Resume theme?

1. Install the theme locally. The easiest way to do that is with NPM.

    ```bash
    npm install jsonresume-theme-classy
    ```

2. Pass the theme folder path into HackMyResume:

    ```bash
    hackmyresume BUILD resume.json --theme node_modules/jsonresume-theme-classy
    ```

3. Check your output folder. It's best to view HTML formats over a local web server connection.

## Should I keep my resume in version control?

Absolutely! As text-based, JSON-driven documents, both FRESH and JSON Resume are ideal candidates for version control. Future versions of HackMyResume will have this functionality built-in.

## Can I change the default section titles ("Employment", "Skills", etc.)?

If you're using a FRESH theme, yes. First, create a HackMyResume options file mapping resume sections to your preferred section title:

```javascript
// myoptions.json
{
  "sectionTitles": {
    "employment": "empleo",
    "skills": "habilidades",
    "education": "educaci√≥n"
  }
}
```

Then, pass the options file into the `-o` or `--opts` parameter:

```bash
hackmyresume BUILD resume.json -o myoptions.json
```

This ability is currently only supported for FRESH resume themes.

## The HackMyResume terminal color scheme is giving me a headache. Can I disable it?

Yes. Use the `--no-color` option to disable terminal colors:

`hackmyresume <somecommand> <someoptions> --no-color`

## What's the difference between a FRESH theme and a JSON Resume theme?

FRESH themes are multiformat (HTML, Word, PDF, etc.) and required to support
Markdown formatting, configurable section titles, and various other features.

JSON Resume themes are typically HTML-driven, but capable of expansion to other
formats through tools. JSON Resume themes don't support Markdown natively, but
HMR does its best to apply your Markdown, when present, to any JSON Resume
themes it encounters.

## Do I have to have a FRESH resume to use a FRESH theme or a JSON Resume to use a JSON Resume theme?

No. You can mix and match FRESH and JRS-format themes freely. HackMyResume will
perform the necessary conversions on the fly.

## Can I build my own custom FRESH theme?

Yes. The easiest way is to copy an existing FRESH theme, like `modern` or
`compact`, and make your changes there. You can test your theme with:

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json --theme path/to/my/theme/folder
```

## Can I build my own custom JSON Resume theme?

Yes. The easiest way is to copy an existing JSON Rsume theme and make your
changes there. You can test your theme with:

```bash
hackmyresume build resume.json --theme path/to/my/theme/folder
```

## Can I build my own tools / services / apps / websites around FRESH / FRESCA?

Yes! FRESH/FRESCA formats are 100% open source, permissively licensed under MIT,
and 100% free from company-specific, tool-specific, or commercially oriented
lock-in or cruft. These are clean formats designed for users and builders.

## Can I build my own tools / services / apps / websites around JSON Resume?

Yes! HackMyResume is not affiliated with JSON Resume, but like FRESH/FRESCA,
JSON Resume is open-source, permissively licensed, and free of proprietary
lock-in. See the JSON Resume website for details.
